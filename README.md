This Teaching Tool is intended to teach coding in Python from scratch from a plant biology perspective. **These educational materials assume no prior experience in plant biology or coding**. It is impossible to teach the breadth of introductory plant biology and data science in a few lessons. Rather, these materials selects specific examples in which mathematical and modeling approaches intersect with the biology of plants.

Coding and plant biology can be intimidating to those with no prior experience. This course is designed to make these disciplines welcoming. **A diversity of perspectives is vital to combat the grandest challanges of our time and there is no room for gate-keeping and shaming: Your contributions to the comptuational plant science community are needed and precious.** These materials are meant as an introduction, for you to **develop *your* skills** to **pursue *your* intended impacts**. There are no wrong answers: use this material in whatever way is useful for you to further your education and career and to access the wealth of computational materials available in the plant community. Share this material with others in the same spirit and spread your knowledge.

***Above all, find joy in the way mathematics and modeling can reveal the underlying beauty of plants!***

These educational materials are in Jupyter notebooks, an interactive and reproducible coding environment that can be used for both learning and research.

If you are new to Jupyter and Python, read the [download instructions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DanChitwood/TeachingTools/blob/master/00_GettingStartedWithJupyter.ipynb) or watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDHRKQl_Pq8) on getting started.

You can view the Jupyter notebooks on the nbviewer by clicking on the following link, [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DanChitwood/HRT841_2020/tree/master/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DanChitwood/TeachingTools/tree/master/)

You can ***interact*** with the Jupyter notebooks in an executable environment using mybinder, by clinking on the icon
